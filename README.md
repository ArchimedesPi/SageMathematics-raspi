#This repo is now *partially* **unused**.
It is only maintained temporarily for archival, wiki, and  issue tracking purposes.

=====================================================================================

This is a recompilation of Sage Mathematics for the Armv6l armhf Raspberry Pi.

More info about Sage is available at www.sagemath.org

On this Github repository, there is a issue tracker.
Please do not use it for Sage-related problems, as those should be opened on the [Sage trac wiki/tracker](trac.sagemath.org).
Instead, use it for Sage issues related to the Raspberry Pi.

The downloading and unpacking should occur on the Raspberry Pi itself.
To download:

````
  cd ~
  mkdir sage-math
  cd sage-math
  wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/7z6qry2cu06dhfp/sage-5.8.raspi-hardfp-armv6l-Linux.tar.gz?dl=1&token_hash=AAFSlOce7sCdyBdThWZCcbhEW7Ez0TvhE8GDnWX5Y9KABQ

To untar all the tarball:

````
  tar zxvf sage-5.8.raspi-hardfp-armv6l-Linux.tar.gz

Please report any issues with the multiple images on this repository's issue tracker, as I have not yet tested each image.
